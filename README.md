# Reinforcement Learning Project for League of Legends Champion Select

## Initial Setup
1. Find a directory you would like this code to live on your computer.
2. Type "git clone https://github.com/jjpk1123/Champ-Select-Reinforcement-Learning.git" in the git bash.
3. Open the project in your favorite editor! For example, when using Visual Studio Code, type "code ." while in the cloned directory.

## Usage
As of now, the system is being worked on for general purpose usage. It was written up as a Jupyter notebook, similar to an essay, for CS440 - Intro to Artificial Intelligence, at Colorado State University.
This section will be updated once the program is updated.

## Viewing the Jupyter Notebook
Download and open [this file](https://github.com/jjpk1123/Champ-Select-Reinforcement-Learning/blob/master/JUPYTER_NOTEBOOK/Pecquet-SemesterProject.ipynb) in a Jupyter Notebook session to view the submitted project, with the ability to run commands in the interpreted session. Alternatively, the file is viewable on that GitHub page, and you can read through it!

## Outside Tools
The outside tools I am using are:
   * Champion.gg: Documentation found here: http://api.champion.gg/docs/#api-Champions
        * This tool is my primary one, which will get me an enormous amount of statistics for different champions in different roles with different other champions as their teammates or enemies. It has *almost* everything I need for the project.
   * Riot Games' Data Dragon: Documentation found here: https://developer.riotgames.com/static-data.html
        * This tool will allow me to do a great number of things to make my software easily usable (for me) and to make the output pretty! This service allows me to get images of champions, abilities, etc and more importantly for development it will allow me to get champion's descriptions by id (given to me from champion.gg requests).
   * Reinforcement Learning Algorithm: Taken from Dr. Andersons Fall 2018 'Intro to Artificial Intelligence' course at Colorado State University, and altered to fit my programs needs.
